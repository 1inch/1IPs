## Summary:

1inch Network is exploring the listing of the following ERC-20 token and the corresponding reserves: [link to token]().

Token: [link to token]().

As a part of 1inch Liquidity Protocol approach of progressive decentralization and our long-term plan to transfer more control to the $1INCH stakeholders, token listing decisions - ‘Approve’ or ‘Reject’ - will be undertaken by the $1INCH stakers members.

## Motivation:

To gain approval to support the specified asset:.

1ip is part of 1inch’s commitment towards transparency and community engagement while on the path of progressive decentralization.

## Methodology:

Any new token or reserve listing requires approval from 1inch Government members and liquidity support from the token team/liquidity provider.

Tokens have to be ERC-20 tokens based on Ethereum and each 1ip campaign on 1inch.exchange will last 4 days.

There is **no guarantee that approved tokens or reserves will be listed** even after they are approved by the 1inch Government, since liquidity still needs to be sourced for that token. A token needs at least 1 reserve to be set up to support it. There could also be unforeseen circumstances that result in a listing delay.

To help 1inch Government members in the decision-making process, here is a quick summary of each token:
