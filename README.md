The 1inch Improvement Proposal (1IP) repository is where users can openly propose and discuss possible improvements to the 1inch protocol and governance, as well as 
request for new features and bug fixing. It also exists as a place to share concrete proposals with potential users and the community at large.

Everyone is welcome to submit their ideas by proposing a 1IP [following the template provided](https://github.com/1inch-exchange/1IPs/issues/new/choose), and 
participate in relevant discussions. You may also use this repository to track the ongoing status of all the 1IPs. 1inch would **support and reward** those who 
create solid and implementable 1lPs which contribute to our growth.
